# Zombie-Brain-Freeze  

  ## Overview
  A Unity Word Hangman Style Game with Zombies

  Zombie Brain Freeze was developed with the popular word, guessing game in mind, known as Hangman. In which, the player is shown tiles that represents each letter of a hidden word. Your goal is to correctly guess all the letters of a hidden word before you run out of guesses. Correctly guessing a letter, results in the correct tile being revealed showing the letter(s) and its position(s) in the hidden word. Correctly guessing letters continues; until all of the letters in the word are shown. Incorrect letter guess will cost you a try(you are given 5).

  If you run out of tries/guesses you are given the following options.  You may continue to play by exchanging diamonds that you have earned from your success in the game(requires 500). Or you may earn an extra try by viewing a short video. Additionally, if you find yourself in need of a hint, you may opt to watch a video to reveal a letter.  Otherwise, you have the option to “give up.”  Of course, if you give up, the Zombie wins.
  Story line is as follows; the world needs Hero’s to save them from a zombie apocalypse, a widespread rise of zombies hostile to human life and civilization as we know it. The Zombie’s brain is temporarily frozen on a word.  If you can guess the word, the Zombie is defeated. Otherwise, the Zombie survives and “night of the living dead,” continues.  Consequently, you and the world are at risk, among “the walking dead.”

  Exercise your brain and smarts with thousands of challenging word, build your vocabulary and put your problem solving strategies to the test.
  Feature include: multiple animated Zombie characters displayed on fun background graphics with exciting sound effects; you are given the choice to select the challenge level and view the player stats.
